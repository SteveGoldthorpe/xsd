# XSD - XML Schema Validator 

XSD is a Go wrapper for the C libxml2 library.

XSD is far from complete.  You can validate documents, but on failure you currently
cannot tell why it failed - for this I'm hoping to get some helpful guidance.

## Quick Start

See example_test.go for how to use this library to validate a document.
